### Proposal - 2022 Q3 - Rion Gull

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The new [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs the lead strategist to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.  This is the first such proposal.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

This is a transitional proposal, submitted part way through Q3 of 2022.  The first two months of Q3 operated under v2 of the rules.  This proposal will have less detail than is expected in future, full-term quarterly proposals, but will still provide a very brief summary of the items listed above from the rules doc.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

This is the first strategist proposal, so there are no specific projects to report on from last quarter.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

Less than one month remains in this quarter.  In that time I plan to focus on:

* delegating budgets to other strategists
* implementing the rules we just passed with respect to our interal operations (e.g. updating our Accounting sheet)
* cleaning up our Trello board and revisiting the GitHub migration
* continuing to fund the [Crowdnode tooling](https://trello.com/c/QUOVFBdT/208-crowdnode-tooling-docs) project.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 1,000 DASH from the Incubator general budget.  This will cover budget requests I will delegate to other strategists as well as a reserve to fund projects I'm administering directly.
