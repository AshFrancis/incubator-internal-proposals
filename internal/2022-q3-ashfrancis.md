### Proposal - 2022 Q3 - Ash Francis

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The new [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.  This is the first such proposal.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

This is a transitional proposal, submitted part way through Q3 of 2022.  The first two months of Q3 operated under v2 of the rules.  This proposal will have less detail than is expected in future, full-term quarterly proposals, but will still provide a very brief summary of the items listed above from the rules doc.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

This is the first strategist proposal, so there are no specific projects to report on from last quarter.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

Less than one month remains in this quarter.  In that time I plan to focus on:

* Jembe (Twitter analog built on platform) - there has been work completed on branding and UX that will be finalized in this quarter.
* THORChain & xchainjs - finishing any necessary work for Dash launch on THORChain (and front-ends like THORSwap).
* THORChain Lite Swapping Interface - a new project to build a front-end swapping service for THORChain that could be integrated into Dash mobile wallets. 
* Dash Core Group Collaborations - for example; a Rust RPC client for Dash Core.
* Minor work on other smaller projects including Dash Gov, improvements to the Incubator in collaboration with Rion, etc.  

### Budget Request

I am requesting 900 DASH from the Incubator general budget. This will cover work completed this cycle that is due to be paid this month as well as other work as listed above. Any remaining funds will be allocated towards seeding a reserve fund for future work.
