### Proposal - 2022 Q4 - Tim Munsell (spectaprod)

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the Lead Strategist.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

In Q3 2022 I funded the following Bounties:

* [Dash Ecosystem Infographic](https://trello.com/c/L306RZDn) - This was an inherited bounty, and is nearing completion. This is a graphical representation of the entire Dash ecosystem for quick reference. Link to the current state is in below.
* [Interactive Dash Ecosystem Webpage](https://trello.com/c/djmlrMDC) - This was an inherited bounty, and is nearing completion. This is closely related to the infographic (above). It is the "presentation layer" presenting the infographic for easy display and navigation in a web browser across mulitple languages. You can see the infographic, available interactions, and hosting environment [here] (https://media.dash.org/wp-content/uploads/Dash-Ecosystem-English-4K-2022-05-11.jpg)
* [Automations for platform-test-suite](https://trello.com/c/hBqUETkb) - **Completed** This bounty automated manual operations required to work with the platform test suite. 
* [Read Investments Data from Blockchain](https://trello.com/c/nvmKHDR1) - ~50% complete. This will create a public facing place users can quickly search and reference the history of proposals to MNOs. This will include light data manipulation capabilities and include csv download of project and funding daa for further local analysis.
* [Dashmate Bug Fixes, Improvements & Innovations](https://trello.com/c/11azWJXT) - This is an ongoing bounty to support ongoing development, improvements, fixes, etc. for Dashmate.

My requested budget for the period was 300 Dash, of which 184 was distributed in rewards.

My Q3 proposal alsoo included the following bounties on which I didn't make any progress:

* [Atomic Swaps](https://trello.com/c/o9l91FLG) - This was help up because the contributor assigned to QA wasn't able to complete the work. A new contributor has been assigned.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

During the upcoming In that time I plan to focus on the above Bounties and additionally (depending on the status of Platform):

* [Goal/Challenge Platform](https://trello.com/c/8Hy6K7fE)
* [Dash Incubator Document Repository](https://trello.com/c/PIpozna4)
* [DashSee](https://trello.com/c/UALbkO5H)
* [Decentralized Dynamic Application Infrastructure](https://trello.com/c/q16cvr5A)

I am the strategist for a handful of other bounties that, for various reasons, are temporarily inactive. I have been in contact with contributors about what is needed to begin progressing again.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 600 DASH from the Incubator general budget.  This will cover the budget to fund the projects I'm administering directly, continue continuing to build a reserve fund (currently stands at 116) for launching/completing large projects in the future.
