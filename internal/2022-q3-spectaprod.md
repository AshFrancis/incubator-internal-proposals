### Proposal - 2022 Q3 - Tim Munsell (spectaprod)

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The new [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.  This is the first such proposal.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

This is a transitional proposal, submitted part way through Q3 of 2022.  The first two months of Q3 operated under v2 of the rules.  This proposal will have less detail than is expected in future, full-term quarterly proposals, but will still provide a very brief summary of the items listed above from the rules doc.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

This is the first strategist proposal, so there are no specific projects to report on from last quarter.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

Less than one month remains in this quarter.  In that time I plan to focus on:

* Atomic Swaps - work that was done of the summer is in QA now, assuming it passes QA, rewards will be paid in September
* Reading Investment Data from the Blockchain - progress on this bounty is consistent and steady. Expecting this to continue into q4
* Taking responsibilities for several smaller bounties "orphaned" by recent incubator changes to keep momentum going and contributors contributing
* Depending on the status of Platform, returning attention to several bounties that have been paused, namely Goal/Challenge Platform and Dash Incubator Document Repository.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 250 DASH from the Incubator general budget.  This will cover budget fund projects I'm administering directly, as well as a seeding a reserve fund for launching/completing large projects in the future.
