### Proposal - 2022 Q4 - Rion Gull

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background

The new [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs the lead strategist to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.

From section 5.1.2 (Strategist Proposals):

> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

This proposal is for Q4 of 2022.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

In Q3 I funded the following projects:

| **Project** | **Status** | **Q3 Rewards (DASH)** |
| --- | --- |  ---: |
| Crowdnode Tooling & Docs | Ongoing | 151.8 |
| Strategy Oversight | Ongoing | 120.0 |
| Payment Tools |  Ongoing |104.4 |
| Decentralized TLS/HTTPS for DAPI | Complete | 42.0 |
| Dash Incubator Restructure | Complete | 21.6 |
| Dash Architecture Infographic | Ongoing | 12.0 |
| Dash Incubator Rule Updates | Complete for now | 9.6 |
| Distributed Thumbnail Image Service | Ongoing | 4.4 |
| Electrum Dash | Just getting started | 3.6 |
| Summoners Dash Platform Game | Transferred to Ash | 1.2 |
| **Total** |  | **470.6** |

**Crowdnode Tools** and **Payment Tools** are making good progress.  We have several videos showing their development, as well as a good [demo of the Crowdnode CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbOdgZsJP-c&list=PLZaEVINf2Bq8MDZAN55uyFm8xb05Ek0qE&index=19) (which, under the hood, uses the JavaScript SDK we built as well).  We've gone a lot further on the tooling since that video, but that's the latest demo.

The **"Strategy Oversight"** (name subject to change) line is the strategist delegation rewards from the new rules.  This item replaces the old "Proposal Owner" bounty.  Not sure if we want to make a card for it.  It's not stricly necessary according to the rules, but might be good for consistency - something to discuss later.

I handed over the **TLS** work back to DCG, who requested to finish it themselves.  So that project is complete as far as Incubator is concerned.

We are all familiar with the **restructuring** work.  That is now complete.  The awards paid for the **rule change** is also from our restructuring, which is complete for now.

Doeke produced a nice [**Dash architecture** video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKk_HEwsMY) that animates the infographic developed earlier.  More on that in the next section.

The **distributed thumbnail** image service is use in DashPay.  I believe this is mostly complete, but we need to maintain it and retest as new versions of platform come out.

After all the requests for **Electrum** from the community I decided to get a project up for that in the Incubator.  We got a basic specification done for a first iteration of supporting that.

The **Summoners** game is a project that Ash proposed, and per our rules, a strategist that proposes a new concept needs to have another strategist accept it into Incubator.  I did that, but transferred it immediately to Ash.

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

In this quarter I plan to use funds for the following:

* Delegate budgets to other strategists.
* Continue to fund the Crowdnode and payment tooling projects.
* Finish the thumbnail image project.
* Pick up the GitHub migration project again, either Incubator-wide, or just for my own projects.
* Refine our Accounting sheet.
* Continue cleaning up our Trello board.
* Possibly make a rule change to further simplify them and remove Trello dependency.
* Propose some new concepts to bring more developers into the Incubator.

### Budget Request

I am requesting 1,000 DASH/month for this quarter from the Incubator general budget.  

600 DASH/month will go to cover budget requests from other strategists.  I plan to use most of the remaining 400 DASH/month to fund the projects listed above.  Any left over will build up my reserve.  I'd like to have at least a 3-month buffer at some point, but will unfortunately probably not be possible until next year.
