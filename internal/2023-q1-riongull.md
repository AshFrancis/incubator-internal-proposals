### Proposal - 2023 Q1 - Rion Gull

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs the lead strategist to submit internal budget proposals to the strategic committee.

Section 5.1.2 (Strategist Proposals):

> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

Section 4.5 (Governance):

> The Strategic Committee is responsible to:
> 
> * Approve or reject Incubator rule changes (updates to this document).
> * Approve or reject quarterly budget requests from the Lead Strategist.

This proposal is for Q1 of 2023.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

Last quarter I awarded bounties to the 9 projects listed in section 2 of the [Dash Incubator 2023 Q1](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-incubator-2023-q1) proposal.  Total rewards were 1,463 DASH (~488 DASH/month) from my strategic budget.

See section 2.1 of our last quarterly proposal (linked above) for a more informative narrative about my focus on developer tooling from last quarter as well as this upcoming quarter. 

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

In this quarter I plan to use funds for the following:

* Delegate budgets to other strategists.
* Continue to fund the Crowdnode and payment tooling projects.
* Pick up the GitHub migration project again, either Incubator-wide, or just for my own projects.
* Continue cleaning up our Trello board.
* Make a rule change to further simplify them and remove Trello dependency.
* Finish existing straggling projects such as the thumbnail image project.
* Propose some new concepts to bring more developers into the Incubator.
* Fund a hackathon for a major web2 project (conversations ongoing, should know in 2 weeks if partner is interested).

### Budget Request

I am requesting 1,100 DASH/month for this quarter from the Incubator general budget.  

400 DASH/month will go to cover budget requests from other strategists.  Of the remaining 700 DASH/month I am targeting 500 DASH/month for output rewards, and 200 DASH/month to build my reserve from just under 2.0 months (current state) to 2.8 months.  See the [Reserve Planning tab of our Incuabtor Accounting Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhXlo4ylqWLLSYN4MGiLWlp7Gq3jrsDt0kB701dwMNU/edit#gid=118961896) for details.  I'd like to have at least a 3-month buffer next quarter.
